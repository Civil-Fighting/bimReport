Thanks, Colin!

I (Laszlo Menczel aka Speaker) converted the textures to TGA format and resized the ones not conforming 
to the power-of-two texture size rule of Quake3. Also renamed the textures to conform to the name conventions 
of sky boxes in Quake3 (i.e. using the postfixes _bk, _ft, _lf, _rt and _up). 
The original boxes did not have 'down' textures. 
I made a 512x512 neutral grey image and added copies of this to each sky box as a fake 'down' texture.
